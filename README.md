This project analyzes **60 years of country-level CO₂ emissions** (1960–2020) using World Bank data to quantify national contributions to climate change. Through R and the tidyverse, it cleans, visualizes, and highlights critical patterns in emissions inequality, revealing that **just 10 countries account for 65% of cumulative emissions**.
